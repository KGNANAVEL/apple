Got it ✅ — you want a **README.md** file for your GitHub project so visitors see your project description and live link.

Here’s a clean one you can use for your **Apple React project**:

# 🍏 Apple Website Clone (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)

If you want, I can also add:
- A **project features list** (so people know what’s included).
- A **deployment guide** for React + Vite to GitHub Pages.  

Do you want me to add those into your README so it looks professional like open-source projects?
