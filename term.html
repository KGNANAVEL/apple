        Equate Monthly Instalments (“EMI”) and No Cost EMI
        Instant Cashback Terms and Conditions
        Equated Monthly Instalments (“EMI”) and No Cost EMI
        The following terms and conditions apply to transactions made on the Apple Store Online (www.apple.com/in) and
        at Apple Retail Stores within India, using EMI or No Cost EMI as a payment option:<br>

        Apple India Private Limited (“Apple”) facilitates EMI and No Cost EMI. You will be presented with EMI and No
        Cost EMI payment options if your total transaction order meets the relevant minimum order value for your
        eligible card as set by your eligible card issuer, and in the event that Apple is running a No Cost EMI
        promotion.<br>

        For No Cost EMI, the amount equivalent to the total amount of interest payable on an EMI transaction will be
        discounted from your total transaction value upon choosing the No Cost EMI payment option. You will be liable to
        repay the principal loan amount and applicable interest to your eligible card issuer.<br>

        No Cost EMI is available with the purchase of an eligible product made using qualifying cards on 3-, 6-, 9-, or
        12-month tenures from most leading card issuers. Eligible AirPods, HomePod and Beats products are available with
        No Cost EMI on 3- and 6-month tenures only. Monthly pricing is rounded to the nearest rupee. Exact pricing will
        be provided by your card issuer, subject to your card issuer’s terms and conditions. Minimum order spend applies
        as per your card issuer’s threshold. No Cost EMI is not available to Business customers and cannot be combined
        with Apple Store for Education or Corporate Employee Purchase Plan pricing. Card eligibility is subject to terms
        and conditions between you and your card issuer. Offer may be revised or withdrawn at any time without any prior
        notice.<br>

        Representative examples:
        A purchase of ₹79900.00 repaid over 12 months with an interest rate of 15.99% p.a. and No Cost EMI savings of
        ₹6514.00 requires monthly payments of ₹6658.00. Total amount payable: ₹79900.00.<br>

        EMI and No Cost EMI are offered by and subject to the terms and conditions applicable between you and your
        eligible card issuer. Apple is not involved in any approval, extension, pricing, modification, pre-closure,
        closure or any matter incidental to offering the EMI payment option financing to you. This is decided at the
        sole discretion of your eligible card issuer.<br>

        In the event of a price reduction of product(s) between the time your order is placed and shipped, Apple will
        automatically reduce the price paid for your product(s) accordingly. Apple will issue a credit equal to the
        price reduction to the original payment method. You will continue to be liable to repay the EMI principal loan
        amount and applicable interest to your eligible card issuer.<br>

        You understand that Apple may share your transaction order information with your eligible card issuer and you
        expressly consent to this sharing of data for these purposes.<br>

        Apple shall have no liability in the event your eligible card issuer refuses to process your EMI or No Cost EMI
        payment option transaction.<br>

        Apple on a best-effort basis displays representative EMI– and No Cost EMI–related information (EMI amount,
        interest rate charged and total amount payable) for your purchase as per the information shared with Apple by
        your eligible card issuer on an “AS IS“ basis. Your eligible card issuer is the authoritative source of this
        information and you are advised to contact your eligible card issuer for any further clarifications in this
        regard. For more information, we request you review the terms and conditions of your eligible card issuer
        offering such EMI payment options.<br>

        Apple does not charge you any processing or convenience fee for the purpose of facilitating an EMI or No Cost
        EMI payment option. Your eligible card issuer may charge processing and/or convenience fees in accordance with
        the terms and conditions applicable between you and your eligible card issuer.<br>

        In the event that you have a complaint, dispute or enquiry about an EMI transaction, we advise you to approach
        your eligible card issuer.<br>

        In the event that you cancel or return your product(s) purchased using an EMI or No Cost EMI payment option,
        Apple may facilitate a refund in accordance with the Apple Retail India Sales Policy. You are advised to check
        with your eligible card issuer how cancellation(s) or refund(s) will affect EMI and any pre-closure or interest
        charges levied on you.<br>
        
        Local sales tax, GST, and all other applicable taxes and levies will apply to all orders and shall be payable by
        you.<br>

        The EMI and No Cost EMI payment options may be combined with other Apple promotions that are directed to
        individual end-user consumers and offered during the same promotional period on the Apple Store Online, subject
        to the terms, conditions, and limitations applicable to this promotion and such other Apple promotion(s).<br>

        cashback amount being recalculated. Where a recalculation takes your total transaction value below the minimum

        account for instant cashback clawback; this may result in no refund being made to you.<br>
